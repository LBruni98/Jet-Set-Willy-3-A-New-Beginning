## Overview

#### Game Description
Willy is back after a long relaxing break, but it's not the comeback he was expecting. After a huge party, a hungover Willy gets a visit from a nemisis: the Taxman! After skimping on his taxes and cashing out on nessecities for himself, it turns out that the taxman is gonna get his sick dream of repossessing ol' Willy. Now, our hero has to scrounge his own bizzare, party ridden mansion to find his money or the taxman will take all of what he has earned!

Jet Set Willy 3: A New Beginning is the third unofficial sequel and homage to that of an icon to 80's british gaming. What I aim to create is a game that captures the original gameplay of the past games and build upon that a slight bit of combat and a small humourous story. The player has to find any available money around the mansion, traverse many obstacles and avoid any enemies to help pay of the Taxman's debt.

#### Player
The player takes control of the main character, Miner Willy. A semi-retired miner and playboy, owner of a large mansion filled with bizzareness
